npm install popper.js 						(popper.js@1.14.6)	- Required by Bootstrap
npm install bootstrap 						(bootstrap@4.1.3)
npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-free	(@fortawesome/fontawesome-free@5.5.0)

Add below the other imports at the top of main.ts
	import 'bootstrap';
	import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
	import "@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/fontawesome.min.css";

		Eventually you will want to look into which .css files best suit your needs. You can reduce the amount of data the user will need to download by choosing the appropriate file.

If you wish to use jQuery yourself in your code
	npm i @types/jquery

	Add to `plugins: []` of webpack.config.js
		new ProvidePlugin({ $: "jquery", jQuery: "jquery", "window.jQuery": "jquery" }),
